# Calculator
Create a Java calculator using Swing, AWT, and Events for GUI, user interaction, and arithmetic operations.

Java: The core programming language used to write the logic and functionality of the calculator.

Swing: A part of Java's standard library, Swing is used to create the graphical user interface (GUI) components like buttons, text fields, and panels.

AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit): Provides the foundation for creating windows, graphics, and user interface elements. Swing builds on top of AWT to offer more sophisticated components.

Events: Event handling is crucial for interactive applications. In this project, you'll use event listeners to respond to user actions, such as button clicks.

The project involves designing a simple calculator interface with buttons for digits (0-9), operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), and a display area. You'll write the logic to perform calculations based on user input and update the display accordingly
